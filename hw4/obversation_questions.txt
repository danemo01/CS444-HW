Q1.

After dumping I've notice that the the PTE's showcase that the pages are cleaned. After converting
the values of each PTE's. I can see that each's V,W,U bits are 1 (or 7 in this case). 
Meaning that the first 4 PTE's are clean.

PTE0= {vpn 0, hasn't been touched}



Q2. 

PD->PTE[pfn] = (pfn)000 - (pfn)fff

Since we were able to obtain the first PTE, pfn being 0. We were able to find the PTE 
that represented VA 50000, by understanding that one page represents 1024 memory location and
we have verified (we can figure this out later) that the PA and VA are identical.

Then after understanding that PFN = X is 0xX000-0xXfff then we've learned that the start of
the tutor program is at 0x52140

Q2B

The ones that hasn't been touched is PTE 51, 53 and below PTE 50 is PTE 4f and PTE 4e




Q3.

We looked at the PTE's 3 flags and was shown that it has been accessed, after using md 3007
and checking the PTE again, we see that the access bit has been set to 1. Then after doing
ms 3007 hi we then check the PTE again and see that the dirty bit has been set to 1.

(actions that occur)
mdd 3002    | PTE has now been access and touched
mdd 52000   | evaluate that
ms  3002 hi | Now PTE is dirty and has some memory
mdd 52000   | Evaluate it from that PTE[3] has been access and is dirty

Q4. 

(actions that occur)
ms 5200c 3006   | access bit is now 0 and cannot be accessed from MMU 
md 52000 | eval that PTE[3] access bit is 0
mdd 3000 | access memory address from PTE[3]000 - PTE[3]fff

As you can see we obtain a page fault, and I believe the Question is misleading.
The caching is not implemented due to the pagefault occuring.

If TLB was there, we would've been able to still access PTE[3]'s VA space due to
the fact that TLB hasn't been updated? or does it reverify if any changes has happen
to the PTE? 



Question 4's issue is that we are still obtaining the page fault, need to ask professor skablayat

Q5. 

actions need
rd all | check regs
rs CR3 51000 | Does nothing because there's no TLB?
rd all | regs are the same.

After learning that Q4 doesn't have the TLB to verify this bug (TLB caching when we simply manipulate a PTE)
Defintely 'rs CR3 51000' does nothing at all... no TLB there for way of flusing it.

Q6. 
ms 5200c 5007 | we technically copy the content for PTE
ms 3231 cool | we randomly put something in
md 3231 | we read that VA
md 5231 | we read another VA, similar contents
ms 3231 1234 | we write in VA 3000 but now it's going to be sent to PA 5000
md 3231 | the content I wrote
md 5231 | also here as well seems that PTE[3] and PTE[5 has the same space :o


I was able to use MS to copy the PET from PET[3] to PET[5], by doing read and write from 
the VA 0x3000-0x3fff the MMU will now assume that VA is referring to PA 0x5000-0x5fff

Q7  

ms 51c00 00000000


I decided set ms 51c00 000000000, and the VMware gave me an error and then
proceeding to restart tutor again.
